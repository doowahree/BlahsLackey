# Intro

Very rough work of bot for the Aegis group. Anyone in Aegis Channel who wants to edit it may edit. This is deployed thru
Heroku.

Does not use off the shelf discord solution because its support was discontinued, so just using custom solution using
Discord's direct gateway apis.

Horrible code quality and barely any comments.
May add comments if I get more motivation.
